# Color Distribution Analyzer

### Overview
**Color Distribution Analyzer** is a Python-based application that lets users analyze color distributions within an image. By selecting or dragging an image file, users can specify custom colors (in hex format) and adjust sensitivity to identify similar colors in the image. The app generates a pie chart to visually represent the color distribution based on the user's input.

### Key Features
- **Image Selection**: Choose or drag-and-drop an image file.
- **Color Input**: Input colors in hex format (e.g., #FFDF7F, #900DFF).
- **Sensitivity Adjustment**: Fine-tune color matching sensitivity.
- **Pie Chart Visualization**: View a color distribution chart of matching colors within the image.
